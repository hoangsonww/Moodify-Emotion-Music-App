    "### 1. Install Dependencies\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# It is recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing dependencies.\n",
    "# Use the following commands in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a virtual environment\n",
    "python -m venv .venv\n",
    "\n",
    "# Activate the virtual environment (adjust based on your OS)\n",
    "# On Windows:\n",
    "# .\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "\n",
    "# On macOS/Linux:\n",
    "# source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install dependencies\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "# To install PyTorch with GPU support, use the command below:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install PyTorch (for CUDA 11.8)\n",
    "pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118\n",

    "### 4. Training the Text Emotion Model\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# You can train the text emotion model using the `train_text_emotion.py` script.\n",
    "# Run the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "python ai_ml/src/models/train_text_emotion.py\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make sure to adjust the script for GPU or CPU use.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Testing the Emotion Detection Models\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# After training, test the emotion models (text, speech, and facial) using the `test_emotion_models.py` script. Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "python ai_ml/src/models/test_emotion_models.py\n",
    "\n",
    "# The script will prompt you to select the model and input files (audio, image, or text) for testing.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Running the Flask APIs\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# The API server can be started by running the following command. The API includes endpoints for emotion detection and music recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "python ai_ml/src/api/emotion_api.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Testing the APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing `/text_emotion` Endpoint\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Example command for testing the text emotion endpoint in macOS/Linux (Terminal):\n",
    "curl -X POST \"http://127.0.0.1:5000/text_emotion\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"text\": \"I am feeling very happy today!\"}'\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Music Recommendation Model\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# To directly test the music recommendation model using the Spotify API, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "python ai_ml/src/recommendation/music_recommendation.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Notes and Tips\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "- Pre-trained models can be downloaded using `download_models.py`. Ensure models are stored in appropriate directories.\n",
    "- Place datasets in the `data/` folder for training and testing.\n",
    "- If you encounter any issues, feel free to check for compatibility between the tools and versions you are using.\n",
